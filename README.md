## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Tommy!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twm11/) 

Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities to apply my skills and acumen in a data analyst role ðŸ“Š. Most recently, I was a product manager at a wholesale building materials distributor. I graduated from Willamette University in â€˜21 with my Masterâ€™s of Business Administration ðŸŽ“, and a certificate in data science ðŸ”¬, on top of my Bachelors â€˜20 ðŸ“œ. Iâ€™ve always been a â€˜whyâ€™ guy. I love gaining a deeper understanding of data by uncovering latent insights to illuminate that â€˜whyâ€™ ðŸ’¡. **Check out my pinned repoâ€™s to see some of my work.**
